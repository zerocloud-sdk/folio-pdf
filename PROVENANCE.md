# Clean-room provenance record

This repository is an independent Apache-2.0 implementation. The accepted
program specification, context glossaries, ADRs, public standards, public API
documentation, and project-owned tests are the permitted design inputs.

## T01 bootstrap record

- Authorship: OpenAI Codex generated and integrated the T01 implementation and
  documentation at the repository operator's direction. The eventual human
  committer remains responsible for review and DCO certification; this T01
  execution creates no commit.
- Project inputs: issue #1, issue #2, the repository context map and Document
  Engine glossary, and ADR-0002, 0004, 0006, 0008–0010, 0012–0015, 0025,
  0029, 0030, and 0032.
- Runtime and test dependencies: Apache PDFBox 3.0.8 and its required
  transitives are Apache-2.0; JUnit 4.13.2 is EPL-1.0, Hamcrest Core 1.3 is
  BSD-3-Clause, and SnakeYAML 2.2 is Apache-2.0. Exact coordinates and roles are
  recorded in [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md).
- Build tooling: Maven Wrapper 3.3.4 scripts were generated from the official
  Apache Maven plugin under Apache-2.0. The wrapper retrieves Apache Maven
  3.9.16 under Apache-2.0 and verifies the declared distribution SHA-256. Maven
  build plugins declared by the project are Apache-2.0.
- CI tooling: `actions/checkout` at commit `11d5960a326750d5838078e36cf38b85af677262`
  and `actions/setup-java` at commit `cf277c60eb25467037889841efdb72551f06f6c3`
  are official MIT-licensed GitHub Actions.
- Local matrix tooling: the Apache-2.0 Podman CLI runs official Eclipse Temurin
  JDK 8, 11, 17, and 21 images. The image definitions are Apache-2.0 and the
  OpenJDK binaries use GPL-2.0 with the Classpath Exception. These tools are
  validation inputs and are not redistributed in project artifacts.
- Test fixtures: T01 creates temporary blank documents entirely through the
  project-owned Native Interface; no external PDF fixture is included.
- Excluded inputs: no iText source, resource, fixture, decompiled or
  binary-derived implementation detail, closed add-on material, or proprietary
  differential evidence was used.
- Compatibility Curator evidence: none; the role is vacant and the T01
  capability remains `experimental`.
